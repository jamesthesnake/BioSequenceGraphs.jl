"""
A SequenceGraphNode represents nodes or vertices in a sequence graph.

Conceptually, a node in a sequence graph is a node which posesses a
biological sequence, such nodes may be connected to other nodes through
'Links'.

SequenceGraphNodes are directional. They have a start (marked '+'),
and they have an end (marked '-').

Furthuremore, nodes are canonical or palindromic sequences, else they are reverted.
